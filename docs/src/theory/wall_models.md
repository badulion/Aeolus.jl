# Wall models

An LES of the atmospheric surface layer or of a high-Reynolds-number
channel cannot resolve the near-wall eddies: the first grid point sits
in the logarithmic layer, where the resolved velocity gradient is far
too weak to carry the wall stress through the sub-grid viscosity. A
*wall model* supplies that stress from the resolved velocity at the
first point (Piomelli & Balaras 2002). In Aeolus every modelled wall
stress comes from one module, `Aeolus.WallModels` (Phase 57, #169); the
channel harness, the stable-boundary-layer cases and the Berlin ground
call it rather than writing their own.

## Equilibrium laws

An equilibrium law relates the wall-parallel speed ``U`` at the distance
``h`` from the wall to the friction velocity ``u_τ = \sqrt{τ_w/ρ}``,
assuming the layer between the wall and ``h`` is in equilibrium (no
pressure gradient, no advection). The wall stress is
``τ_w/ρ = u_τ^2`` (`wall_stress`, kinematic) and acts against the
velocity, ``τ_{w,i} = τ_w u_i/U``.

**Smooth wall — Spalding (1961).** One formula covers the viscous
sublayer, the buffer layer and the log layer:

```math
y^+ = u^+ + e^{-κB}\left[e^{κu^+} - 1 - κu^+ - \frac{(κu^+)^2}{2} - \frac{(κu^+)^3}{6}\right],
\qquad u^+ = U/u_τ,\quad y^+ = h u_τ/ν .
```

It tends to ``u^+ = y^+`` as ``y^+ → 0`` and to the log law
``u^+ = \ln(y^+)/κ + B`` as ``y^+ → ∞``. Given ``U``, ``h`` and ``ν``,
`friction_velocity` solves ``u^+ y^+(u^+) = Uh/ν`` by Newton's method,
safeguarded by the bracket ``0 < u^+ ≤ \sqrt{Uh/ν}`` (the left side is
convex and increasing, so the iteration converges monotonically once it
is above the root). Measured: the round trip ``y^+ → u^+ → y^+`` over
``y^+ ∈ [10^{-2}, 10^6]`` (200 points) is exact to 8.7e-15, and
``u_τ`` is recovered to 9.3e-16. The defaults are κ = 0.41, B = 5.2;
`LEE_MOSER_2015` has the constants of the ``Re_τ ≈ 5200`` channel DNS,
κ = 0.384, B = 4.27.

Spalding's formula is *not* the log law at moderate ``y^+``: truncating
the exponential after the cubic leaves it above the log law by
``δu^+ ≈ [e^{-κB}(1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6) - u^+]/(dy^+/du^+)``,
``x = κu^+``. This is 2.5e-3 at ``y^+ = 10^4``, 7.2e-4 at ``10^5`` and
1.4e-4 at ``10^6`` (measured, equal to the estimate to 0.1 %). The
issue's original expectation, 1e-3 at ``y^+ = 10^4``, was wrong for
this formula.

In the viscous sublayer (``h^+ < 1``) the law is the linear stress
``τ_w = νU/h``, the stress `CutCell.wall_shear_stress` computes from a
probe at the same distance; at the probes of a flat cut-cell floor
(``h^+ ≤ 0.40``) the two agree to 9.5e-6.

**Rough wall, neutral — `RoughLogLaw(z0)`.**
``u_τ = κU/\ln(h/z_0)``, independent of ν.

**Rough wall, stratified — `MOSTWallLaw(sf, z0m, L)`.** Monin–Obukhov
similarity for momentum at a held Obukhov length ``L``:

```math
u_τ = \frac{κ\,\max(U, U_{min})}{\ln(h/z_{0m}) - ψ_m(h/L) + ψ_m(z_{0m}/L)} .
```

Nothing here is restated: κ is `SurfaceExchange.von_karman`, and the
denominator is the stability-corrected log term of
`SurfaceExchange.solve_surface_layer` with the stability functions'
`psi_m`, so at the solver's ζ the law returns the solver's ``u_*`` bit
for bit (tested at ζ = ±0.5), and with ``L = ±∞`` it is the rough log
law (1e-12). A surface model that returns only ``u_*`` hands its
stability over through `matching_obukhov_length`, the ``L`` for which
the law gives back that ``u_*`` (the root of the monotone
``Φ_m(ζ) = κU/u_*``, by the solver's Illinois iteration).

## The operator

`apply_wall_stress!(sim, wm, Δt)` applies the stress of a law to the
first velocity level next to the z-walls of a `RegularGrid`, as a
`post_predictor!` hook. The speed of a column is taken at the centre of
its wall cell (``h = Δz/2``); a face shared by two columns gets the mean
of the two columns' stresses, a column contributing only at its own wall
level, so a level mask can describe an immersed floor (the roof-aware
Berlin ground). Three formulations:

| `formulation` | stress | reference |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `:local` | ``τ_w(U)\,u_i/U`` | Schumann (1975), Grötzbach (1987) |
| `:schumann` | ``⟨τ_w⟩\,u_i/⟨U⟩``, ``⟨τ_w⟩ = τ_w(⟨U⟩)`` | Schumann (1975) |
| `:moeng` | ``⟨τ_w⟩[⟨U⟩(u_i - ⟨u_i⟩) + U⟨u_i⟩]/(⟨U⟩\,|⟨\mathbf u⟩|)`` | Moeng (1984) |

Each is affine in the face velocity, ``τ_{w,i} = a u_i + b``, and is
applied implicitly,

```math
u_i ← \frac{u_i - Δt\,b/Δz}{1 + Δt\,a/Δz},
```

so the stress is evaluated with the end-of-step velocity. The explicit
form is unstable for ``Δt\,a/Δz > 2``; this one decays monotonically and
never changes sign for any Δt (tested at 100× the explicit limit for the
rough and the Spalding law). The momentum it removes is exactly
``Σ τ_{w,i} ΔA Δt`` (measured ≤ 1.3e-15 relative), and nothing else
changes: `w`, the other levels and the halo and finite-volume code are
untouched, so on a free-slip `ImpermeableWall` the wall model is the
only momentum flux through the wall face.

## In the Berlin case

The ground of the flagship is this operator with a `MOSTWallLaw` per
column: `z0m` from the surface's roughness (the per-class table), `L`
from the last surface step, ``u_τ`` re-evaluated at the instantaneous
first-air wind every step (see [The Berlin case](../design/berlin_case.md)).
With ``L`` and the wind frozen it reproduced the drag the example used
to carry (``u_*^2/U`` held between surface steps) exactly.
